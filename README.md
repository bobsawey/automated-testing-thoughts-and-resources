# Headless Testing Helpers
An attempt to outline getting headless testing up and in running as quick, easy, and effectively in today's ever-modernizing landscape.

As of right now I am doing a Landscape Review and will try to choose ONE set of tools and methods to write up. I'm currently leaning toward Ghost Inspector w/ Selenium.

I'll try to set up a demo with Selenium Builder ~~soonish. ~~. probably never.
