An attempt to get headless testing up and in running in today's ever-modernizing landscape.

# Landscape Review
## Small but big reason I made this repo...
[Selenium IDE Firefox add-on end of life](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/08/21/selenium-ide-firefox-add-on-end-of-live/)

## Resources.
[Chromeless, Chrominator, Chromy, Navalia, Lambdium, GhostJS, AutoGCD -- Headless Chrome is shaking up traditional approaches to test automation](https://medium.com/@kensoh/chromeless-chrominator-chromy-navalia-lambdium-ghostjs-autogcd-ef34bcd26907)

### Utilities
[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) - Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome.

[CasperJS](http://casperjs.org ) - CasperJS is a browser navigation scripting & testing utility written in Javascript for PhantomJS or SlimerJS.

#### Do utilities for record and playback exist? If not what needs to happen?
